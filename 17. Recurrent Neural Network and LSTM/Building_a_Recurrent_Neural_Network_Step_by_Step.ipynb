    "Objectives:\n",
    "### Key Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define the notation used in building sequence models.\n",
    "* Describe the architecture of a basic RNN.\n",

    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) excel in Natural Language Processing and other sequence-based tasks due to their \"memory\" capabilities. They process inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ (such as words) sequentially, retaining contextual information through hidden layer activations that are carried from one time step to the next. This enables a unidirectional (one-way) RNN to use past information to influence future inputs. Conversely, a bidirectional (two-way) RNN can leverage context from both the past and the future, similar to Marty McFly's time-traveling abilities.\n",

    "* The forget gate is a tensor with values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    * A value close to 0 in the forget gate indicates that the LSTM should \"forget\" the stored state in the corresponding unit of the previous cell state.\n",
    "    * A value close to 1 suggests that the LSTM will mostly retain the corresponding value from the previous cell state.\n",

Similarly, in recurrent neural networks, the derivatives with respect to the cost function are calculated to update the parameters.
