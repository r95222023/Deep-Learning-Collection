    "These debiasing algorithms are very helpful for reducing bias, but they aren't perfect and don't eliminate all traces of bias. For example, one weakness of this implementation is that the bias direction $g$ was defined using only the pair of words _woman_ and _man_. As discussed earlier, if $g$ were defined by computing $g_1 = e_{woman} - e_{man}$; $g_2 = e_{mother} - e_{father}$; $g_3 = e_{girl} - e_{boy}$; and so on, and averaging over them, a better estimate of the \"gender\" dimension in the 50-dimensional word embedding space would be obtained.
